# Requirements for the Orbax development environment.
#
# Note: There is bug in `pip` when multiple packages use the compatible release
# operator `~=` to specify a version and one of those versions ends in `0`. See
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9613 for more information. In this case,
# use the equivalent clause `>=x.0,==x.*` instead of `~=x.0`.
#
# This assumes that the packages follows Semantic Versioning, see
# https://semver.org/. If a package follows a different versioning scheme or
# requires unique handling, we use a different version specifier and comment the
# versioning scheme or reasoning.
