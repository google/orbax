## [0.1.6] - 2022-03-22

### Fixed
- Small bug fixes.

## [0.1.5] - 2022-03-17

### Added
- Use a more precise timestamp when generating temporary directory names to
permit more than one concurrent checkpointing attempt per second.

## [0.1.4] - 2022-03-15

### Added

## [0.1.3] - 2022-03-03

### Added
- `sharding` option on `ArrayRestoreArgs

## [0.1.2] - 2022-02-17

### Added
- Add "standard user recipe" to documentation.
- Add unit tests using mock to simulate preemption.
- Logging to increase transparency around why checkpoints are kept vs. deleted.
- Expand on uses of restore_args in colab.
- Expose utils_test.
- Add msgpack_utils to move toward eliminating Flax dependency.
- CheckpointManager starts a background thread to finalize checkpoints so that
checkpoints are finalized as soon as possible in async case.

### Changed
- Remove CheckpointManager update API.
- Remove support for deprecated GDA.
- Add tmp suffix on step directory creation in CheckpointManager.save.

### Fixed
- Preemption when using keep_time_interval caused the most recent steps before
preemption to be kept, despite not falling on the keep time interval.

## [0.1.1] - 2022-01-30

### Added
- A util function that constructs restore_args from a target PyTree.
- CheckpointManager `delete` API, which allows deleting an existing step.
- Made dev dependencies optional to minimize import overhead.

### Changed
- Refactored higher-level utils in checkpoint_utils, which provides
user-convenience functions.
- Guard option to create top-level directory behind `create` option.
- Remove support for Python 3.7.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-01-04

### Added

- Check for metric file in addition to item directory in CheckpointManager.
- Additional logs to indicate save/restore completion.
- Support for None leaves in PyTree save/restore.
- ArrayCheckpointHandler for individual arrays/scalars.
- `read: bool` option on all_steps to force read from storage location instead
of using cached steps.
- Simplified "Getting Started" section in the docs.
- CheckpointManager creates the top level directory if it does not yet exist.
- Write msgpack bytes asynchronously.

### Changed
- Removed some unused test_utils methods for filtering empty nodes.
- Update docs on `PyTreeCheckpointHandler`.
- Removed unneeded AbstractCheckpointManager.

### Fixed

- Usage of bytes_limiter to prevent too many bytes from being read during a
single restore call.
- Temp checkpoint cleanup when using a step prefix (i.e. 'checkpoint_0').

## [0.0.23] - 2022-12-08

### Added

- Option to customize metadata file name for Tensorstore.

### Fixed

- Restore failure on GCS due to misidentification of checkpoint as
"not finalized".

## [0.0.22] - 2022-12-05

### Added

- Added CHANGELOG.md for version updates (additions and changes), ingested by
auto-publish functionality.

## [0.0.21] - 2022-12-05

### Changed

- Fix mistaken usages of placeholder "AGGREGATED" where "NOT-AGGREGATED" would
be more appropriate. Ensure backwards compatibility is maintained.
