        "# Partial Saving\n",
        "\n",
        "As deep learning models grow, often to hundreds of billions of parameters, managing their checkpoints becomes a significant challenge. Modifying a large checkpoint, even for a small change like adding metrics or a single layer, traditionally requires an inefficient \"load-modify-save\" cycle. This process uses lots memory and I/O bandwidth, as the entire multi-terabyte checkpoint must be loaded from storage, changed in memory, and written back out.\n",
        "\n",
        "Partial saving is designed to solve this problem by allowing you to modify a checkpoint without loading the entire object into host memory. It dramatically reduces peak memory usage, minimizes redundant I/O, and simplifies common model update workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Core Concept: The Partial Save Session\n",
        "\n",
        "Partial saving operates on a \"session\" or \"transaction\" model. Instead of overwriting your checkpoint directly, Orbax stages all changes in a temporary, in-progress location. The workflow consists of two stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Incremental Updates**: Calls to functions like `ocp.partial.save_pytree` contribute data to an in-progress checkpointing session. These changes are staged in a temporary location and are not yet visible at the final checkpoint path. From the user's perspective, the first save call simply begins this incremental process, and subsequent calls add to it.\n",
        "2. **Finalization**: A concluding call to `ocp.partial.finalize` completes the session. This action commits all the staged changes, making the checkpoint available at its final destination and ready for consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach ensures that the modification process is safe and atomic. If the process is interrupted before finalization, your original checkpoint remains untouched.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note**: Partial saving currently does *NOT* support replacing data written out in previous save calls. If you have a need for Partial Saving Replacement (as opposed to the currently supported Partial Saving Addition), please reach out to the Orbax Checkpointing team so that development of this feature can be prioritized.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> The canonical way to do Replacement without partial saving is by loading the model, updating values in memory, then saving back out.\n",
        "\n",
        "### API and Basic Usage: Adding to a Checkpoint\n",
        "\n",
        "The partial saving API is available in the `orbax.checkpoint.v1.partial` module, but you'll likely access it via `ocp.partial`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common (and only supported) use case is adding new data (leaves or subtrees) to an existing PyTree checkpoint. The provided PyTree in a save call represents a set of updates. If a key does not exist in the on-disk checkpoint, it is treated as an addition. If a key already exists, it is viewed as a replacement (currently not allowed), and results in a `NotImplementedError`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Code Example: A Simple Addition Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start with an initial training state, then update that state with new data in a separate step."
