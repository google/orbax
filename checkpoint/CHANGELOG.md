# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Custom `finalize` callback for `CheckpointHandler`.

### Changed
- Barrier synchronization in `AsyncCheckpointer` refactored to allow plugging in
alternative implementations.
- Added `parent_dir` under `ParamInfo` and modified sharding file to be saved
under `ParamInfo.parent_dir`.
- In `all_steps`, minimize disk queries on non-leader processes.
- Put `all_steps` load on single host and broadcast feature behind an option
that defaults to False.

## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-28

### Changed
- Forked `AsyncManager` into Orbax and replaced `AsyncCheckpointer`'s
inheritance from it with composition for easier customization.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-20

### Added
- Added support for automatically inferring sharding if not provided by
`RestoreArgs`.

### Fixed
- Fix sync error with removing old checkpoints.
- Fix missing checkpoint benchmarks images in RTD page.
https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/optimized_checkpointing.html#introducing-ocdbt

### Changed
- Use `nest_asyncio` by default. This allows users to make calls to orbax from
within `async` functions.
- Modified `StringHandler` serialization and deserialization to use Tensorstore
Json driver for async file reads and writes.
- Marked `transform_utils` as deprecated.
- Change `PytreeCheckpointHandler`'s parameter `use_ocdbt` default to `True`
- Modified sharding property in value_metadata to
`jax.sharding.Sharding`

## [0.3.5] - 2023-08-17

### Fixed
- User metadata when dealing with empty nodes that follow non-empty nodes in a
list.

### Changed
- Modify `_get_user_metadata` to exclude empty nodes.

### Fixed
- Fix GCS issue where an error would be encountered when trying to save a step
with the same number as an existing tmp directory. This scenario arises when
restarting after preemption, without enabling `cleanup_tmp_directories`
in `CheckpointManager`.
- Fix `create_coordinator_server_and_context()` breaking old codes that expect it to return a tuple.  The function also prints a deprecation warning.

## [0.3.4] - 2023-08-15

### Added
- `StandardCheckpointHandler`.

## [0.3.3] - 2023-08-12

### Fixed
- Fix concurrency issue when `are_locked` check lags behind checkpoint deletion.

## [0.3.2] - 2023-08-01

### Added
- Fully self-describing PyTree checkpoints with type information, stored in
metadata using JSON format (not currently enabled by default).
- PyTree leaf metadata returned by `metadata` function (dependent on the
above.)

### Fixed
- Correctly set TYPESTR_REGISTRY, to account for OCDBT option.

### Removed
- Deprecated `restore_args_from_target` function.


## [0.3.1] - 2023-07-27

### Added
- Option to not port `global_shape` to `ArrayRestoreArgs`.

### Removed
- Protobuf metadata saved by PyTreeCheckpointHandler.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-07-24

### Added
- `close` method for Checkpointer and CheckpointHandler.
- Context manager helper functions for Checkpointer and CheckpointManager.
- Protobuf metadata saved by PyTreeCheckpointHandler.

### Changed
- Allow calling `create_coordinator_server_and_context` without an initialized
JAX coordinator server and create TS metadata for numpy arrays on a single process.
- Refactor TypeHandler to operate over batches of values, rather than individual ones.
- Removed support for lazy restoration. Supported via transformations.

## [0.2.6] - 2023-06-28

### Added
- ProtoCheckpointHandler.

### Fixed
- Fix issue with `multi_value_fn` in restoration where an input value could be
loaded many times unnecessarily.
- Eliminates hosts sync on background thread and fixes issue with reading
lockfile before checkpoint is finalized.
- Fix unlocking function, which may fail if there are multiple evaluators
running concurrently.

## [0.2.6] - 2023-06-16

### Added
- Locking mechanism for `checkpoints_iterator` to prevent checkpoints from
being cleaned up by a `CheckpointManager` in another process while the are being
read.
- Allow saving the aggregated file asynchronously.

### Changed
- Slightly different behavior for `wait_for_new_checkpoint`, allowing it to
wait until a certain checkpoint, rather than strictly after a given step.
- Allow value_fn and multi_value_fn to accept RestoreArgs as an argument when they are used during restore, so that the user may customize the returned value based on what is requested by RestoreArgs.

### Fixed
- Support creating sharded array when ArrayRestoreArgs is passed and the value
was originally aggregated.

## [0.2.5] - 2023-06-09

### Added
- Support `max_to_keep=0`.
- Support for PyTree keys with '/' (Ã  la Haiku).

### Fixed
- GCS error when `cleanup_tmp_directories=False` which caused an internal
assertion to be raised when saving over an existing temporary directory.

## [0.2.4] - 2023-06-01

### Added

- `merge_trees` function in `transform_utils`.

### Changed
- Explicit Python version support for 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Raise ValueError when trying to save jax.Array to the aggregate file if it is
not fully replicated.


## [0.2.3] - 2023-05-12

### Added

- Raise error message when the user tries to save host local arrays that are
typically obtained using pmap.

### Added
- Option to allow users to disable automatic temporary directory cleanup upon
