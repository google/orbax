# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added an option `use_compression` to `PyTreeCheckpointHandler` to
  control whether compression will be used. Default is kept `True`.
- v1 Added `ArrayOptions.Saving.use_compression` to control whether compression
  will be used. Default is kept `True`.
- Add `LocalPath` for testing process-local storage.
- Added new memory metrics into benchmark library

### Changed

- #v1 Modify LeafHandler definitions so that `AbstractLeaf` or
`Type[AbstractLeaf]` are always accepted as valid abstract values.

## [0.11.25] - 2025-09-10

### Changed

- Move temporary path detection into `TemporaryPath` class. This class serves
as a natural place for encapsulating core temporary path detection logic.
- Simplify `find_step_path` logic by removing special casing for different
filesystems - instead depending on `TemporaryPath` to identify uncommitted
paths.
- Remove the `jax_pmap_no_rank_reduction=False` code path for
`utils.fully_replicated_host_local_array_to_global_array`.
`jax_pmap_no_rank_reduction=True` by default in JAX.
- Changed to minimum jax version requirement to v0.6.0

## [0.11.24] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- Add support to enable orbax internal metadata inside root metadata.

### Changed

- Broadcast max steps as well when using single_host_load_and_broadcast.
- Allow changing tensorstore backend through environment variable
  `TENSORSTORE_GCS_BACKEND`. The default is `gcs`. Utilizing `gcs_grpc` instead
  provides roughly double the GCS performance.

## [0.11.23] - 2025-08-18

### Added

- Add support for sharded loading from Safetensors checkpoints onto a JAX mesh.

- Allow ArrayMetadataStore to update existing metadatas.

### Added

- Orbax Emergency Checkpointer will now do single slice restore from persistent storage.

## [0.11.21] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed

- Fix incorrectly specified timeouts waiting for signals in background threads.
Decrease timeout to 60s.

### Changed

- #v1 Modify saving code to eliminate cross-thread event loop sharing.

## [0.11.15] - 2025-06-13

### Changed

- #emergency-checkpoint Stop including barrier processes in barrier names. This
information should be redundant, since the barrier ID always corresponds 1:1
with the provided processes ('local_all_steps':
processes_excepting_primary_slice, 'find_complete_slice`: all_processes).
- #emergency-checkpoint Support a `keep_period` like the regular
`CheckpointManager`.
- #v1 Default using V1 LeafHandlers

## [0.11.14] - 2025-06-09

- #v1 Distinguish between `force` and `overwrite` save params.
- Enable `pinned_host_transfer` for GPU backend only.
- #perf Add/update logs with time logs for save paths.
- Simplify str of NameFormats.
- `LoadCheckpointFromOrbax()` expects correct `weight_names` and `weight_specs`.

## [0.11.13] - 2025-04-30

### Changed

- Support for `jax.sharding.PositionalSharding` has been removed since it has
  been deprecated in JAX and will be deleted in a future JAX release. Please
  use `jax.NamedSharding` instead.
- #v1 Reverse handler resolution order so that the most recently registered
handler is preferred when multiple handlers would do the job. This increases
convenience for users - if they are registering their own handlers then they
would want them to be preferred.

### Added

- #v1 Add `JsonHandler`.
- #v1 Add `training.Checkpointer`.
- #v1 Add checkpointables support for `training.Checkpointer`.
- `PartsOf` structure which holds a PyTree whose leaf nodes may be missing.

metadata presentation.
- #v1 Add v1 to `orbax/checkpoint/__init__.py`.

## [0.11.11] - 2025-04-07

### Changed

- Asynchronous directory creation enabled by default.
- Remove `CheckpointInfo.is_locked` as it is not used anymore.

### Added

- #v1 Add metadata free functions.
- #v1 Add CheckpointableHandlerRegistry and handler resolution functions.
- #v1 Add `CompositeHandler`, similar to the current
`CompositeCheckpointHandler`, but different in the sense that it will not be
visible to the user and is solely a helper layer for save/load functions.
- #v1 Implement `save/load_checkpointables` in terms of V0 APIs. Resolve
handlers for checkpointables using V1 APIs.
- `ocp.PLACEHOLDER` for partial restoration.
- `tree_trim` utility function for matching PyTree structures.
- #v1 Add `ProtoHandler`.

### Changed

- Improve `NameFormat.find_all` performance using
 `single_host_load_and_broadcast` strategy.

## [0.11.10] - 2025-03-20

### Added

- Add `fallback_sharding` option to `StandardRestoreArgs` to support restoring
on different topologies easily.
- `Placeholder` value that can be used during `PyTreeCheckpointHandler` restoration to partially restore a PyTree.

### Fixed

- Fix pinned_host loading by ensuring `memory_kind` is carried through when creating in-memory buffers.

## [0.11.9] - 2025-03-17

### Added

- `ocp.tree.utils.tree_difference()` to compute differences between PyTrees.

### Changed

- Re-enable `replica_parallel` feature. This was previously disabled due to
performance concerns, but these have been identified as relating to the
`pinned_host_transfer` feature instead.
- #v1 Refactor `Context` and expand global options.
- #v1 Add `CheckpointMetadata` definitions.
- Enable `ArrayMetadata` persistence globally.
- #emergency-checkpoint Create root directory automatically.

## [0.11.8] - 2025-03-07

### Changed

- Set JAX version requirement back to >= 0.5.0.

## [0.11.7] - 2025-03-06

### Added

- V1: `PyTreeHandler`.
- V1: Introduce Context and its usage as a contextmanager.
- V1: Add `ArrayStorageOptions` to customize per-leaf saving behavior for
arrays (e.g. `dtype`).
- `PlaceholderHandler` type handler for partial restoration project. Placeholder
values will not be loaded during checkpoint restoration.

### Fixed

- Fix RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED while writing array_metadatas.
- Internal/external mirroring was temporarily broken and a few changes were not
pushed when intended (since 2-27). However, there are only a few such changes,
which are reflected in the CHANGELOG.
- Fix ReadTheDocs breakage and fix a number of formatting issues.
Refactor `orbax.checkpoint.logging` in service of this objective.

### Changed

- Improve `Cannot serialize host local jax.Array` error message.

### Added

- support saving and restoring jax.random.key() in PyTree.
- `CheckpointableHandler` for V1.
- Support single-slice checkpointing in `emergency.CheckpointManager`.

## [0.11.6] - 2025-02-20

### Added

- Allow concurrent CheckpointManager.save requests and wait_until_finished.
- `orbax.checkpoint.experimental.v1` code structure, particularly including core
types and save/load free functions.
- Introduce `AsyncResponse` in V1 library. This is not much different from
`ocp.Future`, but serves as a generic type representing a result from a
background task. It also incorporates typing, in contrast with its predecessor.

### Changed

- Move process_metadata to the checkpoint_num directory
- Updated default JAX version requirement to 0.5.0.

## [0.11.5] - 2025-02-10

### Fixed

- Enable OCDBT read coalescing for remote storage

### Added

- `ocp.metadata.get_step_metadata(path)` to public api.

## [0.11.4] - 2025-02-07

### Changed

- Updated orbax-checkpoint PyPI package to exclude tests.

### Fixed

- `AsyncCheckpointer` completion logging, to log on all hosts instead of just
the leader.

## [0.11.3] - 2025-02-06

### Changed

- Improve local file read by disabling OCDBT read coalescing

## [0.11.2] - 2025-02-04

### Added

- `custom_metadata` parameter to `Checkpointer.save()`,
`AsyncCheckpointer.save()`, and `CheckpointManager.save()`, which saves a custom
dict of user metadata to `StepMetadata`.

### Fixed

- Add a check to prevent zero-sized arrays from being saved. This behavior
already resulted in an error, but it was one that was difficult to parse.

## [0.11.1] - 2025-01-28

### Changed

- Add user-facing `TreeMetadata` object returned by
`PyTreeCheckpointHandler.metadata`. This object mimics an ordinary PyTree to
make the change unnoticeable to most users, but also has additional accessible
properties not included in any tree mapping operations.
- `Checkpointer.save()`, `AsyncCheckpointer.save()` also saves `StepMetadata`.
- Added Github actions CI testing using Python versions 3.10-3.13.
- Standardize naming of the "custom metadata" field (user-supplied metadata) as
`custom_metadata`.
- Add `SaveDecisionPolicy` to better encapsulate various options around choosing
whether or not to perform a save at a particular step.

### Added

- The ability to specify a custom `snapshot_dir` in `checkpoints_iterator`.
- `CommitFutureAwaitDirectorySignals`, `CommitFuture` and
`HandlerAwaitableSignal` for signalling between Checkpointing layers to enable
async directory creation.
- Added `AsyncOptions.create_directories_asynchronously` flag to enable creating
directories asynchronously.
- A policy that allows for checkpointing as often as possible, as long as a
save is not already in progress (continuous checkpointing).
- User-provided custom PyTree metadata.

### Fixed

- Fix a bug where snapshots are not released by `wait_for_new_checkpoint` when a
custom `snapshot_dir` is specified.
- Disable `raise_array_data_missing_error` in `PyTreeCheckpointHandler`
restoration code path.
- Partially revert `replica_parallel` feature, as performance regressions have
been observed. Note also that simply setting `use_replica_parallel=False` does
not fix the issue.
- Disable `enable_pinned_host_transfer` option as poor performance has been
observed.

## [0.11.0] - 2024-12-30

### Fixed

- Resolve default value of Handler.typestr if method missing.

### Added

- Add announcement for grain version compatibility. See
 https://github.com/google/orbax/issues/1456.


## [0.10.3] - 2024-12-19

### Added

- `HandlerTypeRegistry` that globally tracks all handler types, which will allow
`CompositeCheckpointHandler.metadata()` to retrieve item metadata by
default-constructing `CheckpointHandler`s when they're listed in the saved
`StepMetadata` but aren't found in the checkpoint.

### Fixed

- Ignore not-exists and not-dir errors while building step metadata in
 _StandardNameFormat.
- Fix `Self` import in `replicator_checkpoint_manager.py`.

### Changed

- Return `StepMetadata` from `CompositeCheckpointHandler.metadata()`.

## [0.10.2] - 2024-12-04

### Added
- Tests and documentation for `abstract_arrays`.
- [Experimental Feature] Support `empty NamedTuple` leaf when
 `PyTreeMetadataOptions.support_rich_types=true`.
 - Enable `replica_parallel` saving. Uses cache to avoid recomputing
`devices_indices_map` for arrays with identical shape/sharding.
- Add Layout support to args.StandardRestore
- [emergency checkpoint] Open-source emergency checkpointing integration test
script.

### Fixed
- Fix namedtuple empty value typestr when experimental support_rich_types is
 disabled again after enabling it.
- Fix metadata ser/deser of jax registered container nodes like flax.struct.
- [emergency checkpoint] Fix local restore by re-mapping device ids directly
instead of inferring them from how process indexes changed across restarts
with some false assumptions.
- Avoid duplicate reads of the same index when loading.
- Fixed a regression bug on restoration with custom Layout.

### Changed
- Coordination service now supports barrier reuse - eliminate some barrier name
complexity, including counters.


## [0.10.1] - 2024-11-22

### Added
- [emergency checkpoint] Add ReplicatorCheckpointManager implementation for
interoperating with replicator service provided by GKE (or theoretically,
any other similar service).

### Fixed
- Correct issue where emergency checkpoint debug logging was not OSS-ed.

## [0.10.0] - 2024-11-21

### Added
- Add `RootMetadata` and `StepMetadata` classes as ways for the user to
interface with checkpoint metadata at various levels.
- Add `root_metadata_serialization`, and `step_metadata_serialization` modules
that contain utilities to perform de/serialization for `RootMetadata` and
`StepMetadata`.
- `ReplicaSlice`/`ReplicaSlices` construct to facilitate saving replicated
arrays.
- Added restoring with custom jax.experimental.layout.Layout support
- Add experimental `PyTreeMetadataOptions` to manage rich types in pytree
 checkpoint metadata.
- Create a separate namespace package `orbax.checkpoint.testing` for exporting
 test objects.
- `replica_parallel` saving that allows arrays with replicated shards to be
saved cooperatively by multiple hosts.
- [Experimental Feature] Support `NamedTuple` and `Tuple` nodes in PyTree
 metadata.
- Add validation to prevent loading an array index that was never written to.
- Add logging to detect missing chunks to emergency checkpointing to facilitate
local checkpoint debugging.

### Changed
- Refactor metadata/tree_test.py and move common test types to
 `test_tree_utils.py` for better reusability.
- [emergency checkpoint] Break out mesh construction and process ID metadata
utils into a separate file.
- Rename `CheckpointMetadataStore` to `MetadataStore`, and change methods to
accept and return metadata as dictionaries.
- Move `Checkpointer` implementations to `_src`.
- Add/Update tests for `is_empty_or_leaf` and `is_empty_node`.
- Refactor and restructure constructs from `type_handlers.py` and `metadata`
 package to avoid circular dependencies.

## [0.9.1] - 2024-11-11

### Added
- Introduce `CheckpointManagerOptions.should_keep_fn` as an alternative to
 `CheckpointManagerOptions.keep_period`.

### Fixed
- Fix readthedoc build failures on source files in `_src`

## [0.9.0] - 2024-11-08

### Changed
- Create `Composite` class, which `CompositeArgs` now subclasses.
- Move `tree` to `_src`.
- Move `serialization` to `_src`.
- Move `type_handlers` to `_src/serialization`
- Add notes to Barrier error `XlaRuntimeError(DEADLINE_EXCEEDED)` with
 actionable info.
- Make `NameFormat.find_all` impls concurrent.
- Move `path` package under `_src` package.
- Updated readthedoc

### Fixed
- Emergency checkpoint: use JAX for global_max and combine multiple broadcasts
into one for `saved` bool broadcast. This should alleviate concerns about
broadcasting using the distributed system at large scale.
- Emergency checkpoint: compile broadcast function once at init.

### Fixed
- Fix emergency checkpointing issue arising when repeatedly restoring from a
local checkpoint. Process ID remapping may happen in different ways on
subsequent times, so we need to ensure new process metadata is saved with every
checkpoint, so we can recover the process ID mapping used to save that
checkpoint.

## [0.8.0] - 2024-10-29

### Fixed
- bytes_per_sec calculation needs different values for read and write.

### Added
- Add a `SaveArgs` option that allows disabling pinned host transfer on a
per-array basis. UPDATE: Modify `enable_pinned_host_transfer` option to be
provided once for the entire pytree, since it's not really reasonable to
customize this on a per-array level.

### Changed
- Rename `CheckpointManager._single_item` to `CheckpointManager._default_item`.
- Add `strict` option in `ArrayRestoreArgs`, defaulting to True. This prevents
arrays from being accidentally padded or truncated when restoring.
- Move `multihost` implementations to `_src`. Commonly used symbols are still
exported in the same way.
- Use `Fragments` for serialization.
- Set `AsyncOptions.timeout_secs` default value to 10 minutes.
- De-duplicate `get_ts_context` usages and move to ts_utils.
- Move `logging` to `_src`.
- Move `metadata` to `_src`.

## [0.7.0] - 2024-10-07

### Removed
- Support for Python 3.9.

### Changed
- Modernize type annotations using `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Adjust `CompositeCheckpointHandler` behavior for unregistered items and empty
  `args`. Now, `metadata` only returns entries for which an item actually
  exists in the checkpoint. `restore` will raise an error if a requested item
  does not exist, and will attempt to restore all existing items if empty `args`
  are provided.
- Allow registering an item in `DefaultCheckpointHandlerRegistry` without
  providing the actual handler, as long as the provided args correspond to a
  globally registered handler. This allows for slightly reduced verbosity if we
  just want to ensure an association between an item name and args/handler.
- Refactor to extract a separate module, `asyncio_utils`, for asyncio helper
 functions from `path/async_utils` module.
- Rename `CheckpointMetadata` to `StepMetadata`.

### Added
- Support nested `asyncio.run` with `nest_asyncio` library.
- Support empty tuple values in checkpointable params.


## [0.6.4] - 2024-09-17

### Fixed
- Return empty dict (instead of None) as metadata for *empty* Mapping typed
 unregistered types.
- Restore to user mesh after emergency checkpoint local restoration.

 ### Changed
- Removed `write_chunk_shape` and `read_chunk_shape` from `SaveArgs`.
- Rename `is_supported_empty_aggregation_type` and
  `is_supported_aggregation_type` functions.
- Adjust `CompositeCheckpointHandler` behavior for unregistered items and empty
  `args`. Now, `metadata` only returns entries for which an item actually
  exists in the checkpoint. `restore` will raise an error if a requested item
  does not exist, and will attempt to restore all existing items if empty `args`
  are provided.
- Use `CheckpointHandlerRegistry` when `CheckpointManager` is
  default-constructed, e.g. `CheckpointManager(directory)`. Previously this
  usage pattern would default to single-item mode, but the new behavior will
  default to lazy initialization. The change should be a no-op for existing
  users.


## [0.6.3] - 2024-09-10

## [0.6.2] - 2024-09-10

### Added
- Support for `replica_axis_index = 0,1` in `broadcast_one_replica_to_all`.

### Fixed
- Only allow main-thread to reset Save Finalize error.
- Allow Orbax save to run from a non-main thread but continue to support
 concurrent access to wait_until_finished().

### Changed
- Refactor `merge_ocdbt_per_process_files()` to return explicitly without
 merging if none of the child subdir names match `ocdbt.process_` pattern.
- Moved `_choose_chunk_shape` from `type_handlers.py` to a new internal module.

### Added
- Validate merged and saved checkpoint params by comparing it against its
 `.zarray` counterpart.
- Added private utilities to work with array fragments (`_src/arrays`).
- Log `orbax-checkpoint version` when Checkpointer instances are created.
- NamedShardingMetadata includes full device mesh which will be used for
  restoration when sharding in restore_args is not provided.

## [0.6.1] - 2024-08-22

### Added
- Common public types to annotate pytrees.
- Add utils that act as a heuristic for detecting standard Orbax checkpoints.
- Add memory-based rate limiting support during save.
- Metrics to track bytes/sec during save and restore.
- Added `handler_registration.HandlerRegistry` to store custom mappings between
  checkpointable items and checkpoint args to a checkpoint handler.
- Added `handler_registration.HandlerRegistry` argument to
  `CompositeCheckpointhandler`. This replaces the `item_names` and
  `items_and_handlers` arguments for configuring items and handlers.
- Added `handler_registration.HandlerRegistry` argument to
  `CheckpointManager`. This replaces the `checkpointers`, `item_names` and
  `items_and_handlers` arguments for configuring items and handlers.
- Raise error if `AsyncOptions.post_finalization_callback` is given but
 `CheckpointManager._checkpinter` is not async.
- Add Tensorstore memory debug logs when debug message is turned on, eg.
  `--vmodule=type_handlers=1`.


## [0.6.0] - 2024-08-19

### Fixed
- Fix callsites of handler.async_save to handle returned None.

### Changed
- Improve logging by adding jax_process, error logs in threads and more...
- Improvements to blocking save time, as a result of moving file open operations
into the background.
- Consolidate usages of `MultiprocessingOptions` and `AsyncOptions`.
- Formalize `StandardCheckpointer` as an `AsyncCheckpointer` that doesn't
require a `CheckpointArgs` object, and instead allows directly passing the
state and extra args (breaking change).
- Add log messages to improve debugging with jax process and threads.
- Improve logging to turn on DEBUG log per source file.
- Update bytes/sec metrics to be per-host.
- Parallelize many directory creations using asyncio. Also reduce the number
of `asyncio.run` calls by moving `async` functions higher in the stack.
- Allow CheckpointManager.wait_until_finished to be called concurrently.

### Added
- Add utils that act as a heuristic for detecting standard Orbax checkpoints.
- Add memory-based rate limiting support during save.
- Metrics to track bytes/sec during save and restore.

### Removed
- Preliminary concurrent creation of parameter directories from
`PyTreeCheckpointHandler` (in non-OCDBT case).


## [0.5.23] - 2024-07-26

### Changed
- In `CheckpointManager.restore`, allow specifying `step=None`, which
automatically restores from latest.
- Emergency checkpointing bug-fixes for CPU backend.

## [0.5.22] - 2024-07-19

### Changed
- Move `get_param_names` to tree utils.
- Move all work for `_write_metadata_file` into a background thread to avoid
O(n) computation in building metadata.

### Fixed
- Adjust user metadata construction so that older checkpoints with some values
in the msgpack file can still return metadata (though the metadata for these
entries will not return information about array properties).

## [0.5.21] - 2024-07-12

### Added
- Rolled forward change to improve TensorStore I/O efficiency.
- Memory efficient broadcasting from one model replica to others.

### Changed
- Allow one directory creation request per item rather than 1 per item per host.
- Make atomicity logic configurable, and encapsulate it within a class.

### Fixed
- Refactor ts.Context usage to be per-operation (save/restore) rather than a
  global object. This helps fix edge cases where a user repeatedly overwrites
  a single checkpoint.
- Move module-level counters to one place for greater compartmentalization.
  Add logic to the barrier-compatible test fixture that allows each test case to
  have its own module-level counter, to avoid problems that arise when
  multiprocess tests run in inconsistent orders.
- Ensure D2H transfers are parallelized.

## [0.5.20] - 2024-06-20

### Added
- Fork JAX serialization library into orbax/checkpoint.

## [0.5.19] - 2024-06-20

### Fixed
- updated required Jax version to fix PY3.9 build

## [0.5.18] - 2024-06-20

### Added
- Checkpoint format guide for RTD page.

### Changed
- Modify `_write_metadata_file` to Async.
- Added `tree` package to contain tree-related utilities.
- Improve TensorStore I/O efficiency through use of TensorStore
  transactions for the OCDBT storage format, and specify the new
  `can_reference_source_data_indefinitely=True` option to avoid a redundant copy
  when writing into the TensorStore chunk cache.
- Stop writing msgpack file for new checkpoints and update empty nodes handling
so that it no longer depends on this file.

## [0.5.15] - 2024-05-31

### Added
- Introduce `FileOptions` as CheckpointManagerOptions attribute.
- Support non blocking CheckpointMetadataStore.write.

### Fixed
- Deadlock observed when using multiple AsyncCheckpointers at once.

## [0.5.14] - 2024-05-23

- Separate `metadata` package to encapsulate metadata-related utils and
constructs.
- Add step utils to get metadata of latest checkpoint and from checkpoint path.
- Support checkpoint metadata at step level.

  from the public API.

### Removed
- `ocdbt_merge` option and unused `restore_with_serialized_types` option from
`PyTreeCheckpointHandler`.

## Added
- Add CheckpointManagerOptions.enable_background_delete to avoid blocking
  the manager.save() code path
- `broadcast_one_to_some` function.
- Allow running Orbax code on a subset of processes.

## [0.5.4] - 2024-03-08

### Fixed
- Issue in which `CompositeCheckpointHandler` would create item directories
repeatedly in parallel, resulting in multiple requests per host, for every host.

### Changed
- Log `SaveArgs.aggregate` deprecation warning message once in 12 hours.
- If CheckpointManagerOptions.read_only=True then automatically reset "write"
 options (instead of raising error).
- Modify `create_empty` to be `erase_and_create_empty` instead to make its
potential dangers a bit more apparent.

### Added
- Single replica broadcasting when training on multiple hosts/pods. By default,
replica zero along the first axis dimension reads the checkpoint then broadcasts
to other replicas.
- Added experimental_emergency_checkpoint
- `ShardingMetadata` class that represents `jax.sharding.Sharding` properties but does not require accessing real devices.

### Added
- `CompositeCheckpointHandler` API. This will soon replace `CheckpointManager`'s
handling of distinct items, and allows users to work with separate items at the
`Checkpointer` layer.

### Changed
- `use_ocdbt` `PyTreeCheckpointHandler` option is no longer kept as a mutable
global state on type handlers and is now passed around with the state to save or
restore.

### Fixed
- Bug arising when an error occurs in the background thread, and we try to
remove a non-existent checkpoint from `_interval_preserved_checkpoints` in
`CheckpointManager`.

list.

### Changed
- Modify `_get_user_metadata` to exclude empty nodes.

### Fixed
- Fix GCS issue where an error would be encountered when trying to save a step
with the same number as an existing tmp directory. This scenario arises when
restarting after preemption, without enabling `cleanup_tmp_directories`
in `CheckpointManager`.
- Fix `create_coordinator_server_and_context()` breaking old codes that expect it to return a tuple.  The function also prints a deprecation warning.
