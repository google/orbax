# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## Fixed
- Fix TypeHandler Registry errors for `empty ([], {}, None)` values with
 `SaveArgs(aggregate=False)`.

## [0.5.6] - 2024-03-14

### Added
- Add new `step` module with step naming and query support.

### Changed
- Use step `NameFormat` and `StandardNameFormat` in Orbax `CheckpointManager`,
 `utils` and `checkpoint_utils` modules.

## [0.5.5] - 2024-03-11

## Fixed
- Add JAX version guards to changes that require newer version of JAX

## [0.5.4] - 2024-03-08

### Fixed
- Issue in which `CompositeCheckpointHandler` would create item directories
repeatedly in parallel, resulting in multiple requests per host, for every host.

### Changed
- Log `SaveArgs.aggregate` deprecation warning message once in 12 hours.
- If CheckpointManagerOptions.read_only=True then automatically reset "write"
 options (instead of raising error).
- Modify `create_empty` to be `erase_and_create_empty` instead to make its
potential dangers a bit more apparent.

### Added
- Single replica broadcasting when training on multiple hosts/pods. By default,
replica zero along the first axis dimension reads the checkpoint then broadcasts
to other replicas.
- Added experimental_emergency_checkpoint

## [0.5.3] - 2024-02-05

### Fixed
- Fix broken logging issue.

### Added
- Add `reload` method in `CheckpointManager` which resets internal properties.
- Add checkpoint announcements RTD page.

### Changed
- Deprecate `read` option in `all_steps`.
- Deprecate `SaveArgs.aggregate`.
- Update copyright to use 2024. Also, allow notebook cells to continue if last
 cell raises error.
- Improve RTD by using `ocp.utils.to_shape_dtype_struct` instead of `jax.eval_shape`.

## [0.5.2] - 2024-01-26

### Fixed
- Ensure timeout passed via `AsyncCheckpointer` in `CheckpointManager` is
propagated, for legacy compatibility.
- Modified sharding file writes to use `tensorstore.Transaction` due to recent
tensorstore change. This resolves a slowdown in save speed recently observed.

### Added
- Add documentation associated with `item_handlers`, the new arguments
 introduced in `CheckpointManager` constructor.

### Changed
- Update documentation of the new `CheckpointArgs` based `CheckpointHandler` API.


## [0.5.1] - 2024-01-19

### Fixed
- Stop blocking on previous save when `should_save` is False.

### Added
- Expose `AsyncOptions` for `CheckpointManager` users.
- Introduce item_handlers to CheckpointManager ctor to allow configurable
 Handler setup.
- Add JaxRandomKeyCheckpointHandler to store Jax random key generated from 
jax.random.key() or jax.random.PRNGKey()
- Add NumpyRandomKeyCheckpointHandler to store Numpy random state from 
numpy.random.get_state()

## [0.5.0] - 2024-01-16

### Added
- Deprecation warning for users of the old `CheckpointManager` API.
- `CheckpointManager` API migration guide.
- New backwards-compatible API for `CheckpointManager` making use of
`CheckpointArgs` and `CompositeCheckpointHandler`.
- Documentation for new APIs.

### Changed
- Provide better support for custom `CheckpointHandler`s without registered
`CheckpointArgs` by providing a wrapper `CheckpointHandler` as a fallback. This
class is introduced for backwards compatibility, and will eventually be removed.

## [0.4.8] - 2023-12-14

### Added
- New parameter `chunk_byte_size` in `SaveArgs`.  A convenient way to choose 
the write and read chunk shapes using Zarr3.

### Fixed
- Issues interpreting `ValueMetadata` in `construct_restore_args`.

## [0.4.7] - 2023-12-07

### Fixed
- Refactor bad `wait_until_finished` design in `CheckpointManager` where
`wait_until_finished` would try to join a thread, which itself called
`wait_until_finished`.

## [0.4.6] - 2023-12-06

### Added
- `CompositeCheckpointHandler` API. This will soon replace `CheckpointManager`'s
handling of distinct items, and allows users to work with separate items at the
`Checkpointer` layer.

### Changed
- `use_ocdbt` `PyTreeCheckpointHandler` option is no longer kept as a mutable
global state on type handlers and is now passed around with the state to save or
restore.

### Fixed
- Bug arising when an error occurs in the background thread, and we try to
remove a non-existent checkpoint from `_interval_preserved_checkpoints` in
`CheckpointManager`.

## [0.4.5] - 2023-12-04

### Added
- Zarr Version 3 allowing custom write and read chunk configurations

## [0.4.4] - 2023-11-29

### Fixed
- Bug where errors in the background thread of `AsyncCheckpointer` would not be
raised in `CheckpointManager`, causing later errors when trying to remove non-
existent checkpoints.

### Added
- Support for `CheckpointArgs` in core `CheckpointHandler` implementations.
Allowed specifying either `CheckpointArgs` or keyword args in `Checkpointer`.
- Introduce CheckpointManagerOptions.read_only to control save/delete behaviors.

### Changed
- Use `json` directly instead of `JsonCheckpointHandler` to write and read
`PyTreeCheckpointHandler`'s metadata.
- Enable OCDBT-Merge by default

## [0.4.3] - 2023-11-17

### Added
- Introduce CheckpointManagerOptions.todelete_subdir option to rename deletable dirs.
- Support jax.sharding.SingleDeviceSharding in self-describing PyTree checkpoints.
- `name` and `directory` properties in value `Metadata`.
- Introduce AbstractCheckpointManager protocol for the already existing
 CheckpointManager concrete class.

### Changed
- Turn on self-describing PyTree checkpoints by default.
- `CheckpointArgs` arguments for save and restore in `StandardCheckpointHandler`
and `PyTreeCheckpointHandler`.
- Return empty dict if the CheckpointManager level metadata is not available.
Currently it raises error due to missing metadata dir.
- Remove unfinalized checkpoint directory from previous runs for GCS.

## [0.4.2] - 2023-10-03

### Added
- Custom `finalize` callback for `CheckpointHandler`.
- Merge/finalize logic for Tensorstore when using OCDBT driver.

### Changed
- Barrier synchronization in `AsyncCheckpointer` refactored to allow plugging in
alternative implementations.
- Added `parent_dir` under `ParamInfo` and modified sharding file to be saved
under `ParamInfo.parent_dir`.
- In `all_steps`, minimize disk queries on non-leader processes.
- Put `all_steps` load on single host and broadcast feature behind an option that defaults to False.
- Rename StandardCheckpointHandler.save/restore named arg, 'state' to 'item'.

### Removed
- OCDBT coordinator.

## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-28

### Added
- `CompositeCheckpointHandler`
- `CheckpointArgs`

### Changed
- Forked `AsyncManager` into Orbax and replaced `AsyncCheckpointer`'s
inheritance from it with composition for easier customization.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-20

### Added
- Added support for automatically inferring sharding if not provided by
`RestoreArgs`.

### Fixed
- Fix sync error with removing old checkpoints.
- Fix missing checkpoint benchmarks images in RTD page.
https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/optimized_checkpointing.html#introducing-ocdbt

### Changed
- Use `nest_asyncio` by default. This allows users to make calls to orbax from
within `async` functions.
- Modified `StringHandler` serialization and deserialization to use Tensorstore
Json driver for async file reads and writes.
- Marked `transform_utils` as deprecated.
- Change `PytreeCheckpointHandler`'s parameter `use_ocdbt` default to `True`
- Modified sharding property in value_metadata to
`jax.sharding.Sharding`

## [0.3.5] - 2023-08-17

### Fixed
- User metadata when dealing with empty nodes that follow non-empty nodes in a
list.

### Changed
- Modify `_get_user_metadata` to exclude empty nodes.

### Fixed
- Fix GCS issue where an error would be encountered when trying to save a step
with the same number as an existing tmp directory. This scenario arises when
restarting after preemption, without enabling `cleanup_tmp_directories`
in `CheckpointManager`.
- Fix `create_coordinator_server_and_context()` breaking old codes that expect it to return a tuple.  The function also prints a deprecation warning.

## [0.3.4] - 2023-08-15

### Added
- `StandardCheckpointHandler`.

## [0.3.3] - 2023-08-12

### Fixed

- Context manager helper functions for Checkpointer and CheckpointManager.
- Protobuf metadata saved by PyTreeCheckpointHandler.

### Changed
- Allow calling `create_coordinator_server_and_context` without an initialized
JAX coordinator server and create TS metadata for numpy arrays on a single process.
- Refactor TypeHandler to operate over batches of values, rather than individual ones.
- Removed support for lazy restoration. Supported via transformations.

## [0.2.6] - 2023-06-28

### Added
- ProtoCheckpointHandler.

### Fixed
- Fix issue with `multi_value_fn` in restoration where an input value could be
loaded many times unnecessarily.
- Eliminates hosts sync on background thread and fixes issue with reading
lockfile before checkpoint is finalized.
- Fix unlocking function, which may fail if there are multiple evaluators
running concurrently.

## [0.2.6] - 2023-06-16

### Added
- Locking mechanism for `checkpoints_iterator` to prevent checkpoints from
being cleaned up by a `CheckpointManager` in another process while the are being
read.
- Allow saving the aggregated file asynchronously.

### Changed
- Slightly different behavior for `wait_for_new_checkpoint`, allowing it to
wait until a certain checkpoint, rather than strictly after a given step.
- Allow value_fn and multi_value_fn to accept RestoreArgs as an argument when they are used during restore, so that the user may customize the returned value based on what is requested by RestoreArgs.

### Fixed
- Support creating sharded array when ArrayRestoreArgs is passed and the value
was originally aggregated.

## [0.2.5] - 2023-06-09

### Added
- Support `max_to_keep=0`.
- Support for PyTree keys with '/' (à la Haiku).

assertion to be raised when saving over an existing temporary directory.

## [0.2.4] - 2023-06-01

### Added

- `merge_trees` function in `transform_utils`.

### Changed
- Explicit Python version support for 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
