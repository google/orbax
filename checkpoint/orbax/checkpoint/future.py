  """Abstracted Orbax Future class.

  This is used to represent the return value of
  AsyncCheckpointHandler.async_save. This method may return multiple related,
  but potentially distinct, future objects. Common examples may include
  tensorstore.Future or concurrent.futures.Future. Since these types are not
  strictly related to one another, we merely enforce that any returned future
  must have a `result` method which blocks until the future's operation
  completes. Importantly, calling `result` should not *start* execution of the
  future, but merely wait for an ongoing operation to complete.
