  """Partially saves a PyTree.

  This function allows for incrementally updating a checkpoint. It is designed
  to be called multiple times. The first call initiates a new partial save
  "session" in a temporary location. Subsequent calls will update this session
  by modifying the checkpoint in place.

  The operation is atomic; if it is interrupted, the previous version of the
  partial save will be preserved.

  IMPORTANT: The checkpoint is not finalized at the target `path` until
  `ocp.partial.finalize(path)` is called. The intermediate checkpoints are
  temporary and should not be used directly.

  ### Workflow

  A typical partial save workflow involves one or more calls to
  `partial.save_pytree` followed by a single call to `partial.finalize`.

  ```
  path = '/path/to/my/checkpoint'

  # The first call creates a temporary directory:
  # '/path/to/my/checkpoint.partial_save'
  # Note: the exact temporary directory name is an implementation detail that
  # depends on the file system and should not be relied on.
  ocp.partial.save_pytree(path, {'layer1': ..., 'step': 1})

  # A subsequent call reads the previous version and applies new updates
  # to the temporary directory:
  # '/path/to/my/checkpoint.partial_save'
  ocp.partial.save_pytree(path, {'layer2': ..., 'metrics': ...})

  # This call commits the latest version to the final destination at
  # '/path/to/my/checkpoint'.

  ### Additions vs. Replacements

  The provided `pytree` represents a set of updates.
  - If a key in `pytree` (e.g., 'metrics') does not exist in the on-disk
    checkpoint, it is treated as an **addition**. In other words, the sets of
    keys of the on-disk PyTree and the provided `pytree` are disjoint.
  - If a key (e.g., 'step') already exists, its value is **replaced**. In other
    words, the sets of keys of the on-disk PyTree and the provided `pytree`
    overlap. Replacements are currently NOT supported. Please reach out to the
    Orbax team if you need this functionality.

  See `ocp.save_pytree` for general PyTree saving documentation.

  Args:
    path: The path to save the checkpoint to.
    pytree: A PyTree representing the additions to be applied to the on-disk
      checkpoint.
    custom_metadata: User-provided custom metadata. This will be merged with any
      existing custom metadata. Values from this dictionary will overwrite
      existing values if keys conflict.

  Unlike `partial.save_pytree`, this function returns an `AsyncResponse`

  This function allows for incrementally updating a checkpoint. It is designed
  to be called multiple times. The first call initiates a new partial save
  "session" in a temporary location. Subsequent calls will update this session
  by creating a new version that includes all previous changes plus the new
  ones.

  The operation is atomic; if it is interrupted, the previous version of the

  IMPORTANT: The checkpoint is not finalized at the target `path` until

  See `ocp.save_pytree_async` for general PyTree saving documentation.

  Args:
    path: The path to save the checkpoint to.
    pytree: The PyTree to save. This may be any JAX PyTree (including custom
      objects registered as PyTrees) consisting of supported leaf types. Default
      supported leaf types include `jax.Array`, `np.ndarray`, simple types like
      `int`, `float`, `str`, and empty nodes. Support for custom leaves is also
      possible by implementing a `LeafTypeHandler`.
    custom_metadata: User-provided custom metadata. An arbitrary
      JSON-serializable dictionary the user can use to store additional
      information. The field is treated as opaque by Orbax.

  Returns:
    An `AsyncResponse` that can be used to block until the save is complete.
    Blocking can be done using `response.result()`, which returns `None`.

  Raises:

  This function commits all changes made during a partial save session,
  concluding the transaction. It should be called once after all desired
  `ocp.partial.save_*` operations are complete.

  The finalization process is atomic. It renames the temporary, versioned
  partial save directory to the final target `path`, making the updated
  checkpoint "live".

  IMPORTANT: Until `finalize` is called, the checkpoint at the target `path`
  is not created or modified. All changes are buffered in a temporary location.
  This function is what makes those changes permanent.


  ### Example
  ```
  path = '/path/to/my/checkpoint'

  # These calls write to a temporary, versioned directory, not the final path.
  ocp.partial.save_pytree(path, {'step': 1})
  ocp.partial.save_checkpointables(path, {'metrics': ...})

      overwrite, it must be deleted first.
    FileNotFoundError: If no partial save session is found for the given `path`.
