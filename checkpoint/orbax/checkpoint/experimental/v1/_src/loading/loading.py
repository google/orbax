  """Loads a PyTree.

  Loads from a PyTree checkpoint. A PyTree checkpoint must be a path
  containing a subdirectory with name provided by `checkpointable_name`, with
  default value `pytree`. Please see `checkpointable_name` for more details.

  The operation blocks until complete. For improved performance, consider using
  `load_async` instead.

  If `abstract_pytree` is not provided, the PyTree will be loaded exactly as
  saved.

  IMPORTANT: Loading is more brittle and error-prone when not providing
  `abstract_pytree`. Always provide `abstract_pytree` if possible. Note that
  you can always obtain the tree structure from a saved checkpoint using
  `ocp.pytree_metadata`.

  Providing the `abstract_tree` guarantees two things:

  1. The restored tree will exactly match the structure of `abstract_pytree` (or
  raise an error if it is impossible to guarantee this). For example, if
  `abstract_pytree` is a custom object registered as a PyTree, the checkpoint
  will be restored as the same object, if possible.

  2. The leaves of the restored tree will be restored with the properties
  indicated by the abstract leaves. For example, if a leaf in `abstract_pytree`
  is a `jax.ShapeDtypeStruct`, the restored leaf will be a `jax.Array` with the
  same shape and dtype. Each `AbstractLeafType` has a corresponding `LeafType`
  that is restored.

  Args:
    path: The path to load the checkpoint from. This path must contain a
      subdirectory with name provided by `checkpointable_name`. See
      `checkpointable_name` for more details.
    abstract_pytree: Provides a tree structure for the checkpoint to be restored
      into. May be omitted to load exactly as saved., but this is much more
      brittle than providing the tree.
    checkpointable_name: The name of the checkpointable to load. Defaults to
      `pytree`. A subdirectory with this name must exist in `path`. If None then
      path itself is expected to contain all files relevant for loading the
      PyTree, rather than any subdirectory. Such files include, for example,
      manifest.ocdbt, _METADATA, ocdbt.process_X.

  Returns:
    The restored PyTree.

  """Loads checkpointables.

  See documentation for `save_checkpointables` for more context on what a
  "checkpointable" is.

  This function can be used to load any checkpoint saved by
  `save_checkpointables` (or `save_pytree`). The path should contain a
  number of subdirectories - each of these represents the name of a
  checkpointable.

  If `abstract_checkpointables` is not provided, the checkpointables will be
  loaded exactly as saved.

  IMPORTANT: Loading is more brittle and error-prone when not providing
  `abstract_checkpointables`. Always provide `abstract_checkpointables` if
  possible. Note that you can always obtain the information about the
  checkpointables using `ocp.checkpointables_metadata`.

  If `abstract_checkpointables` is provided, the value provided for each key
  is treated as the abstract type for the given checkpointable. For example, for
  a PyTree of `jax.Array`, the corresponding abstract checkpointable is a PyTree
  of `jax.ShapeDtypeStruct`. `None` is always a valid abstract checkpointable,
  which just indicates that the checkpointable should be loaded exactly as
  saved.

  The keys provided in `abstract_checkpointables` may be any subset of the
  checkpointables in the checkpoint. Any checkpointables names not provided in
  `abstract_checkpointables` will not be loaded.

  Args:
    path: The path to load the checkpoint from. This path must contain a
      subdirectory for each checkpointable.

      values are the abstract checkpointable objects themselves.

  Returns:
