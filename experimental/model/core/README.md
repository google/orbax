# ML Export Library

A framework-agnostic library for exporting machine learning models.

Currently contains copies of TensorFlow SavedModel proto definitions. Do not use since this is currently experimental.

Other than some integration tests, anything in this folder should not depend on
any specific ML framework such as TF, JAX or PyTorch.
