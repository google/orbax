  Attributes:
    batch_component: The component to batch.
    max_batch_size: The maximum allowed batch size for any input. If
      `allowed_batch_sizes` is provided, this can be None and infered from the
      largest value in the list. Otherwise, this must be provided.
    batch_timeout_micros: Maximum number of microseconds to wait before
      outputting an incomplete batch.
    num_batch_threads: Number of scheduling threads for processing batches of
      work. Determines the number of batches processed in parallel. This should
      be roughly in line with the number of TPU cores available.
    max_enqueued_batches: Maximum number of batches enqueued for processing
      before requests are failed fast. Default is 250.
    allowed_batch_sizes: Optional list of allowed batch sizes. If left empty,
      all batch sizes no larger than `max_batch_size` are allowed. Otherwise,
      supplies a list of batch sizes. The entries must increase monotonically.
    disable_large_batch_splitting: Whether to disable large batch splitting.
